✅ EXISTS vs NOT EXISTS in MySQL
1. What is EXISTS?
EXISTS is a logical operator that checks if a subquery returns at least one row.
If the subquery returns one or more rows → TRUE
If the subquery returns no rows → FALSE

Example:
-- Find customers who have placed at least one order
SELECT customer_id, customer_name
FROM customers c
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM orders o
    WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id
);

✅ Here:
For each customer_id, MySQL checks the subquery.
If an order exists → customer is included.
If no order exists → customer is excluded.

2. What is NOT EXISTS?
NOT EXISTS is the opposite.
It returns TRUE if the subquery returns no rows.
It is used to filter records that do not have a match.


Example:
-- Find customers who have NOT placed any order
SELECT customer_id, customer_name
FROM customers c
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM orders o
    WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id
);

✅ Here:
For each customer_id, MySQL checks the subquery.
If no order exists → customer is included.
If at least one order exists → customer is excluded.

3. Key Points to Remember
EXISTS → TRUE if at least one row exists in subquery
NOT EXISTS → TRUE if no row exists in subquery.
MySQL stops scanning as soon as it finds the first match (for performance).
Commonly used for checking relationships between tables.
